# churchkey

a tool tunneling ssh over http proxy;

churchkey tunnels ssh sessions through http proxy, so that users can log into
remote server via http proxy if direct access is not working; churchkey uses
http *connect* method and only works with http proxies supporting this method;

churchkey supports two http authentication methods: [basic] and [digest];

technical details are described in [rfc 2817];
